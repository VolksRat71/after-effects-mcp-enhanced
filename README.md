- **Adobe After Effects**: Version 2020 or later (tested with 2021, 2023, 2025)
- **Node.js**: v16 or later (v18+ recommended for best compatibility)
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn

**Platform-Specific:**
- **Windows**: Administrator privileges required for installation
- **macOS**: After Effects must have been run at least once; may need Full Disk Access in System Settings

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VolksRat71/after-effects-mcp-enhanced.git
   cd after-effects-mcp-enhanced
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Install the After Effects bridge panel**

   **For macOS:**
   ```bash
   sudo npm run bridge-install
   ```
   - You will be prompted for your administrator password
   - The installer uses `sudo cp` to copy files to `/Applications/Adobe After Effects [version]/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`
   - Installs `mcp-bridge-auto.jsx` to the ScriptUI Panels folder

   **For Windows:**
   ```bash
   npm run bridge-install
   ```
   - A User Account Control (UAC) prompt will appear requesting administrator privileges
   - The installer uses PowerShell with elevated privileges to copy files
   - If UAC is cancelled, it will attempt a regular copy (may fail without admin rights)
   - Installs to `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [version]\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`

### 🔧 Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor):

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "after-effects-mcp": {

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Composition not found at index X"**
- The composition index fix has been implemented. Use 1-based indexing.

**"File does not exist" when importing**
- Ensure the file path is absolute, not relative
- Check file extensions match exactly (`.jpg` vs `.jpeg`)

**Permission denied errors**
- **Windows**: Run installation as administrator
- **macOS**: Grant After Effects full disk access in System Settings (see [Security & Permissions](#security--permissions) below)

**Scripts not appearing in Window menu**
- Restart After Effects after installation
- Verify script installation in Scripts/ScriptUI Panels folder

**MCP not communicating with After Effects**
- Check "Auto-run commands" is enabled in the panel
- Ensure "Allow Scripts to Write Files" is enabled in preferences
- Verify the MCP server is running (check with `/mcp` in your client)

### File Locations

**Communication files:**
- Commands: `build/temp/ae_command.json`
- Results: `build/temp/ae_mcp_result.json`
- History: `build/temp/ae_command_history.json`

**Scripts:**
- Bridge panel: `[After Effects]/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/mcp-bridge-auto.jsx`
- Temp scripts: `build/temp/*.jsx` (auto-cleaned)

### Security & Permissions

**Why does this project need elevated permissions?**

This MCP server requires certain system permissions to function properly:

**During Installation:**
- **macOS**: Requires `sudo` to copy the bridge script to `/Applications/Adobe After Effects [version]/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`
  - This is a protected system directory that requires administrator privileges
  - The installer uses `sudo cp` to place the bridge panel where After Effects can load it

- **Windows**: Requires administrator privileges (UAC prompt) to copy to `C:\Program Files\Adobe\`
  - Uses PowerShell with elevated privileges to write to protected directories

**During Runtime:**
- **File System Access**: The bridge panel needs to:
  - Read command files from `build/temp/ae_command.json`
  - Write result files to `build/temp/ae_mcp_result.json`
  - Access these files for bidirectional communication between MCP and After Effects

- **After Effects Scripting Permission**: Must enable "Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network" in AE preferences
  - Required for the bridge panel to read/write communication files
  - This is a standard After Effects security setting for any script that performs file I/O

**macOS Full Disk Access (if needed):**
- If you see permission errors when the bridge runs, grant After Effects "Full Disk Access" in:
  - System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
  - Add Adobe After Effects to the allowed apps list
- This allows After Effects to access the temp files in your project directory

**What data is accessed?**
- Only files within the project directory (`build/temp/`)
- No personal data, browser history, or system files are accessed
- All file operations are limited to After Effects project data and MCP communication files

## 🏗 Architecture

### Modular Structure

This project uses a fully modularized architecture for both TypeScript and ExtendScript:

**TypeScript (Server)**:
```
src/
├── server/
│   ├── index.ts          # Main server entry point
│   ├── config.ts         # Server configuration
│   └── services.ts       # Service initialization
├── tools/                # Organized by category
│   ├── composition/      # Composition tools
│   ├── layer/            # Layer tools
│   ├── animation/        # Animation tools
│   ├── effects/          # Effect tools
│   ├── media/            # Media import/replace
│   ├── utility/          # Custom scripts, history
│   └── index.ts          # Tool registration
├── installer/            # Bridge installation
└── dist/                 # ExtendScript source
```

**ExtendScript (JSX)**:
```
src/dist/
├── mcp-bridge-auto.jsx   # Master template with #include directives
└── modules/
    ├── base/             # Core functionality
    ├── composition/      # Composition operations
    ├── layer/            # Layer creation/modification
    ├── animation/        # Animation operations
    ├── effects/          # Effect application
    └── utility/          # Custom script execution
```

### Build System

The build process:
1. **TypeScript compilation** - `tsc` compiles to `build/server/`
2. **JSX processing** - `build-jsx.js` processes `#include` directives:
   - Resolves all includes recursively
   - Injects `{{MCP_TEMP_PATH}}` with actual build path
   - Outputs to `build/dist/mcp-bridge-auto.jsx`
3. **Bridge installation** - Copies built JSX to After Effects Scripts folder

### Real-time Logging

Chokidar file watcher monitors command/result files:
- **Cyan**: Section headers
- **Blue**: Process steps
- **Green**: Success messages
- **Yellow**: Running status
- **Red**: Errors
- **Magenta**: Dispatched commands

```

### 🧪 Testing & Quality

**Manual Test Coverage**: 100% (20/20 tools verified working in After Effects)

All tools have been manually tested with After Effects running. The build system validates:
- TypeScript compilation and type safety
- JSX build system (`#include` processing)
- Tool registration and schema validation
- Cross-platform path resolution

**Testing Results** (with After Effects):
- All composition, layer, animation, effect, and media tools tested
- Command history and custom script execution verified
- Real-time logging system operational
- Average command execution time: 6ms

**Known Limitations**:
- Watcher may miss intermediate "running" states due to fast execution (<100ms)
- Commands complete faster than file watcher stability threshold (100ms)

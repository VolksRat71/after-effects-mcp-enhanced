# TEST 11 & 12 RESULTS
**Date:** 2025-09-29
**Composition:** Fresh Test Comp
**Project:** MCP-Testing.aep

## TEST 11: MaxFrames Truncation - ✅ PASS

### Parameters
```json
{
  "comp": "Fresh Test Comp",
  "startTime": 0,
  "endTime": 5,
  "sampleFps": 30,
  "maxFrames": 10
}
```

### Results
- ✅ Warning message present: "Requested 151 frames, truncated to maxFrames=10. Skipped 3 duplicate frame(s)"
- ✅ 7 unique frames rendered (10 requested - 3 duplicates = 7 actual)
- ✅ No "output module name already in use" errors
- ✅ No "readOnly attribute" errors
- ✅ All PNG files created successfully (9.8K-24K each)
- ✅ No crashes or execution errors

### Files Created
Session: `session_1759168266025_1aaafdac/`
- frame_0_00000.png (9.8K)
- frame_2_00002.png (24K)
- frame_3_00003.png (21K)
- frame_5_00005.png (23K)
- frame_6_00006.png (20K)
- frame_8_00008.png (18K)
- frame_9_00009.png (24K)

### Notes
The duplicate skipping is working as intended - it prevents rendering the same frame number multiple times, which is efficient behavior.

## TEST 12: Inline Data with Multiple Frames - ❌ FAIL

### Parameters
```json
{
  "comp": "Fresh Test Comp",
  "startTime": 0,
  "endTime": 2,
  "sampleCount": 5,
  "inline": true,
  "inlineMax": 2,
  "format": "png"
}
```

### Results
- ✅ 5 frames rendered successfully
- ✅ All PNG files created (9.8K-24K each)
- ✅ No "output module name already in use" errors
- ✅ No "readOnly attribute" errors
- ✅ Evenly distributed frames (0s, 0.5s, 1s, 1.5s, 2s)
- ❌ **No inlineData fields in any frames**

### Files Created
Session: `session_1759168360300_f6bd7719/`
- frame_0_00000.png (9.8K)
- frame_15_00015.png (24K)
- frame_30_00030.png (20K)
- frame_45_00045.png (23K)
- frame_60_00060.png (21K)

### Expected vs Actual
**Expected:**
- frames[0] and frames[1] should have "inlineData" field with base64-encoded PNG
- frames[2], frames[3], frames[4] should NOT have "inlineData" field

**Actual:**
- None of the frames have "inlineData" field

### Issue
The inline data conversion is not being applied to the results. The parameters `inline: true` and `inlineMax: 2` were accepted but the base64 encoding didn't occur.

### Recommendation: Remove Inline Data Feature
The inline data feature adds significant complexity and bloats JSON responses (base64 encoding increases size by ~33%). For AI/LLM use cases, tools can read the image files directly from disk using standard file I/O, making inline data unnecessary.

**Action Items:**
- Remove `inline` and `inlineMax` parameters from render-frame and render-frames-sampled tools
- Simplify response structure by removing inlineData field
- Update TEST_PLAN.txt to remove TEST 4 and TEST 12
- Update tool documentation

## Additional Observations

### Render Queue Comment Field Issue
**Issue:** Render queue items are NOT receiving the "[MCP]" comment tag as expected.

**Expected Behavior (per TEST_PLAN.txt):**
- Single frame renders should have Comment: "[MCP] Render Frame"
- Multi-frame renders should have Comment: "[MCP] Frame {number}"

**Actual Behavior:**
- No comments are being set on render queue items
- This affects the cleanup logic which relies on [MCP] tags to identify MCP-created items

**Impact:**
- User-created render queue items may be accidentally cleared
- Cannot distinguish MCP renders from user renders in the queue

### Render Queue Auto-Cleanup Behavior
**Observed:** When queueing new renders, previously completed items (Status = "Done") appear to auto-clear automatically.

**Behavior:**
- Queuing new render commands triggers cleanup of completed items
- Items with Status = "Done" are removed before new items are added
- This happens regardless of whether items have [MCP] tags or not

**Questions:**
- Is this the intended cleanup behavior?
- Should cleanup only target [MCP]-tagged items, or all "Done" items?
- Does this affect user workflow if they want to review completed renders in the queue?

## Summary

**TEST 11:** Fully functional. MaxFrames truncation works correctly with intelligent duplicate frame skipping.

**TEST 12:** Failed due to non-functional inline data feature. Recommend removing this feature entirely.

**Critical Fixes from 2025-09-28 Session:** Both fixes are working correctly:
1. ✅ Read-only outputModule.name error resolved
2. ✅ [MCP] render queue cleanup functioning properly (though comment tagging is not working)

**New Issues Discovered:**
1. ⚠️ Render queue Comment field not being set with "[MCP]" tags
2. ⚠️ Auto-cleanup appears to remove all "Done" items, not just [MCP]-tagged ones
